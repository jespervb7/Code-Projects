This repository is a webscrapping project for the world games game data. It would have been faster to manually scrape everything but I figure it would be good coding practice.
With that being said there should be a csv file in here at some point containing the data. Feel free to use it. 

Good to note is that the data quality on the world games site isn't fully accurate. Therefor this data is for reference only and shouldn't be used to drawn conclusions from it. 

Most of the shots on goal are registered as "close shots" however there are alot of balls thrown from second line which fall into this category apparently.
